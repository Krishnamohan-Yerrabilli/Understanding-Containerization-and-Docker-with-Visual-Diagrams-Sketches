# Understanding Containerization and Docker with Visual Diagrams - Sketches

Welcome to the "Understanding Containerization and Docker with Visual Diagrams - Sketches" repository! This repository serves as a collection of drawing sketches that I am currently working on for my book project titled "Understanding Containerization and Docker with Visual Diagrams."

## Introduction

The goal of this repository is to provide visual diagrams and illustrations that enhance the understanding of containerization concepts and Docker technologies. The sketches contained here are intended to complement the written content of the book and convey complex ideas in a more visual and accessible manner.

Throughout the book, I explain over 100+ concepts related to containerization and Docker, covering a wide range of topics such as:

- Container basics and advantages
- Docker image creation and management
- Container networking and orchestration
- Security and best practices
- Performance optimization
- Docker ecosystem and tools
- And many more!

The sketches in this repository are designed to support the explanations and help readers grasp these concepts more effectively.
